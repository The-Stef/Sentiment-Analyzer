6/27/23, 16:53 - Person 2: I don't know how to respond to this revelation
6/27/23, 16:53 - Person 3: Life looks so
6/27/23, 16:53 - Person 3: Realistic
6/27/23, 16:53 - Person 3: Me neither
6/27/23, 16:54 - Person 3: Am gonna ponder the secrets of the universe a bit longer

6/27/23, 16:54 - Person 3: ALSO
6/27/23, 16:54 - Person 3: I had a random thought about the world
6/27/23, 16:55 - Person 3: While I was drinking

6/27/23, 16:55 - Person 3: So I shall enlighten u ppl
6/27/23, 16:55 - Person 3: U know how there was an ice age and we had glaciers and stuff?
6/27/23, 16:55 - Person 2: This explains the random string of thoughts
6/27/23, 16:56 - Person 3: When the glacier melts, we get water but that water is carrying diseases and microbes and stuff from many many many years ago
6/27/23, 16:57 - Person 3: What if the ice age is likd the humans being eradicated and the diseases is stuff from their time
6/27/23, 16:57 - Person 3: Also heard from a random website that we're heading to an ice age (at least some parts of the world)
6/27/23, 16:57 - Person 3: So that got me thinking
6/27/23, 16:58 - Person 3: What if there is an ice age and hundreds of whatevers of years
6/27/23, 16:58 - Person 3: Later
6/27/23, 16:58 - Person 2: That I've heard about

6/27/23, 16:58 - Person 2: 56
6/27/23, 16:58 - Person 3: Basically cycle of life is: We live We wipe out and there's an ice age We live We wipe out and there's an ice age
6/27/23, 16:59 - Person 3: So that could mean
6/27/23, 16:59 - Person 3: It's like
6/27/23, 16:59 - Person 3: A simulation kinda thing
6/27/23, 16:59 - Person 3: Where u just restart
6/27/23, 16:59 - Person 3: So how many times has it been restarted o.o
